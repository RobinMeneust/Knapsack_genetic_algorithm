# Knapsack problem and Genetic algorithm

## About

A small project that uses a genetic algorithm to give an approximate solution to the knapsack problem (an NP-complete problem).
This will be documented and improved (e.g. add graphs).
This project is just a test to help me understand how evolutionary algorithms work.

## Requirements

- JDK
- Maven (not needed if you use another tool to compile)

## Execution

`mvn clean package` and then `java -jar .\target\knapsack_project-1.0.jar`
